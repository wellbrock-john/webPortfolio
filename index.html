						<h3>Hello, I'm John Wellbrock.</h3>
						<h4>I live in Denver, CO.</h4>
						<p>
							I'm a software engineer, excited and ready to work with your team
							and take full advantage of any opportunity thrown my way!
						</p>
						<p>
							I have pursued and continue to pursue my passion for programming
							through adversity and strife. We have all faced numerous trials
							over the last year. As we hopefully begin to emerge as a stronger
							world soon, my hope is to be on a team that is assisting in the
							advancement towards a better, happier and healthier world.
						</p>
					</section>
					<!--About Me section -->
					<section class="personal">
						<a id="AboutMe"></a>
						<h3>About Me</h3>
						<p>
							I have recently finished an intensive Software Engineering
							Immersion certificate program through Thinkful. The exponential
							growth in knowledge and professionalism I have witnessed in my
							team members and experienced myself, will forever be treasured and
							utilized as I begin to advance my career. A fractional list, of
							the quite long list of experiences I've had over the last few
							months, is below.
						</p>
						<ol class="about-list">
							<li>
								I have learned an immense amount about software development and
								what it takes to be part of a team that delivers high quality
								work with hard deadlines.
							</li>
							<li>
								The skill of being resourceful on the web to achieve solutions
								in dealing with pesky bugs or complex problems, is beyond
								measure. I feel blessed to have grown in that skill to an
								affluent level.
							</li>
							<li>
								Challenging myself to push my limits every day in the pursuit of
								learning and bettering my own future has bestowed a revival of
								passion within me to learn, grow, teach and serve others as to
								better our world as best I can.
							</li>
							<li>
								Professional relationships aren't always about work, they can be
								fun!
							</li>
							<li>
								Just because you have to reiterate over some code or maybe even
								a whole project, doesn't mean you're a bad developer. It means
								the client didn't have their needs or desires met yet, and
								that's ok. It's another opportunity to improve.
							</li>
						</ol>
						<h3>Why I Chose Web Development</h3>
						<p>
							I spent the last 6 years in the automotive industry. I followed in
							my father's footsteps and the work was honest. I was always only
							'getting by' though. I wanted to follow my passions. Now, I am
							thrilled to be doing so and I am excited to work with others and
							develop my skills so I can enter the tech industry with a 'hit the
							ground running' kind of momentum.
						</p>
						<h3>Where I am Now</h3>
						<p>
							Currently I am beginning my job search. Ready to be taken in by
							wonderful team who works hard and provides quality work.
						</p>
						<h3>"AFK"</h3>
						<p>
							When I am not toiling away at building programs or websites, I
							love hiking with my dog, Josie, camping, playing competitive video
							games with my friends and spending quality time with people that I
							love, usually sharing a nice meal.
